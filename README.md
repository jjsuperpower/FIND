FIND: Framework for evaluating Image enhancements on Neural networks inferencing in aDverse environments

------

The goal of this project is to test and evaluate using image enhancements to improve adverse environments before being inferenced on by Neural Networks (NNs). A general overview of this methodology is shown below
